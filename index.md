## About Me

I am a second year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/node/1">H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a>, Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/">Prof. Ashwin Pananjady</a> and <a href="https://vmuthukumar.ece.gatech.edu/">Prof. Vidya Muthukumar</a>. Before this, I completed by bachelor's and master's in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of <em>high-dimensional statistics</em>, <em>optimization</em>, and <em>reinforcement learning</em>. I am particularly passionate about developing theoretically motivated algorithms to address fundamental challenges in these fields. Recently, my work has focused on creating techniques that enable effective learning from dependent data. I have focused on:
  * Distribution estimation from dependent samples
  * Stochastic optimization for statistical and machine learning
  * Policy evaluation in reinforcement learning
