## About Me

I am a third year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ashwin Pananjady and Prof. Vidya Muthukumar. Before this, I completed by bachelor's and master's in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, optimization, and reinforcement learning. I am particularly passionate about developing theoretically motivated algorithms to address fundamental challenges in these fields. Recently, my work has focused on creating techniques that enable effective learning from dependent data. I have focused on:
  * Distribution estimation from dependent samples
  * Stochastic optimization for statistical and machine learning
  * Policy evaluation in reinforcement learning
